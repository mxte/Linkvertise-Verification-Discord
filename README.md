## Q&A

#### Why is the code so messy?

This is my first ever time writing a fully complete Flask project. I am still improving on my skills.

#### What do I have to change?

All the things needed to be changed are marked in the files. The files that are marked up are `app.py`, `bot/main.py`, `templates/not_in_guild.html`, and `templates/verify/html`.
